# Tool for Extracting Data From Anypoint Studio for Use in Other Projects
This is based on the mule-metadata-extractor by Agile Digital (https://github.com/agiledigital/mule-metadata-extractor)
Huge thanks to them for doing most of the hardwork.

This repo exists for a few reasons:
1) I do not currently desire to learn Clojure, which is what the original project is in
2) The original project appears to have been abandoned in 2019
3) The original devs never were able to update it to work with Anypoint Studio 7
4) I am still learning development and what better way to learn than patching a project and porting it to Java
